# Chicago Crime Data Analysis (2008-2012)

## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of crime records in Chicago from 2008 to 2012. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in crime incidents and to understand how these incidents correlate with various socio-economic indicators.

## Data Sources
The crime data was sourced from the Chicago Police Department's public records. Socio-economic indicators were obtained from the City of Chicago's data portal. Both datasets were merged to assess potential relationships between crime statistics and socio-economic factors.
